SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTIPLIER
**AIM: **
 To simulate and synthesis multiplier using Vivado Software.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:**
Vivadoâ„¢ ML 2023.2
  
PROCEDURE: Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.
